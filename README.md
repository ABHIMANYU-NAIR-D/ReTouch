# 🌱 ReTouch – Website Prototype

ReTouch is a sustainability-driven initiative that transforms plastic waste into eco-friendly notebooks while building a community of students, schools, colleges, and eco-clubs to fight pollution and promote literacy.  

This repository contains the **prototype website** for ReTouch, built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The site explains our mission and provides a way for people eager to join the revolution to connect with us.

## ✨ Inspiration
ReTouch was inspired by two pressing issues in India:
- Over **3.4 million tonnes** of plastic waste generated annually, with much left unrecycled.  
- Literacy challenges, including **9 million blind people** with only **10% literacy rates**.  

We wanted to connect **waste management** with **education access** — turning plastic waste into learning resources and awareness.
